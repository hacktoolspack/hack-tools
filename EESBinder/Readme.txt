EES binder v1.0
A basic, yet nice binder capable of joining an unlimited number of files 
into one large executable file. Each archived file can have its own attributes 
to be extracted in a folder, executed and have an auto start in the registry. 
No compresion is avilable in this version. The stub can be compressed before 
use by your favorite packer.
