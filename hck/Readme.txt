//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

+ Works perfect under Windows 95 & Windows NT 3.51(Build 1024) or
  later ...its a 32-bit Application with Pentium code, but it works
  under 486 too. Running on 386 is not recommended!
  CPUs Recommended: Pentium, Pentium Pro and AMD-K5
  CPUs NOT Recommended: any 486 and Cyrix 6x86 models.

   Features:

+ Manual Extract with specified offsets & outfile name.
  this is good for ripping many stuff...

+ Low-Level System Functions (like: Run, NT RemoteShutdown, etc.)

+ Cracks password protected .ZIP archives!

+ Creates dummy files with random & optional buffer

+ Include a Hacker's Test

+ Binary file(s) compare...

+ Cracks passwd filez (THE FASTEST DES ENGINE ON EARTH!)
  * Its faster approx. 34% than jack at one account and 4% at
    more than 500 accounts. (on 486)
  * Its faster approx. 40% than jack at more than 500 accounts
    and 50% at one account!. (on Pentium/100)
  * AMD-K5 Kicks ASS!!, AMD-K5 PR100/100MHz is faster approx. 75%
    at one account than Intel Pentium/100MHz !!!, and faster with
    85% than Cyrix 6x86 P166+

  * Supports up to 10000 accounts at one time.

Note!!!!: Don't test it with c/s, because da fucking jack says more
          c/s than it does, test it with c/min. and count with your
          own timer.
          The c/s (cracks/second) & c/m (cracks/minute) from HU is
          approximative, to get better results let HU at least 1
          minute to work and then press the right mouse button!

  * Full cracking status
  * Multitasking

+ Extract words from text or binary files.

+ Sort words

+ Words Wizard

+ Network/TCP-IP tools...

  * Finger
  * Ping
  * Port Scanner (its not yet optimized for InterNet)
  * CRASH Windozes...(Crashes any remote Windows running TCP/IP with
    Client for Microsoft Networks installed).

+ Console extension for passwd crack, xtract and sort.

Technical stuff:
   - HU source code contains 57 .CPP & .H files with 12000 lines and 322KB,
     and 1 .ASM file with 4780 lines and 129KB (guess what's this ASM?)
     ...it is the DES routine fucking optimized...
     All the stuff is compiled with VC++ 4.xx and MASM 6.xx

Note: Even This release of HU is free!, maybe a future version will be
      commercial :)

here is how to kontakt us...
