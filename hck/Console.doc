DISCLAIMER:
**********

We, ATAPi & DirectX, take no responsibility for anything You *might*
experience by using these tools, be it legal problems, thrashed harddisks or
anything else. You use these tools at Your own risk!

INTRODUCTION:
************
 i had written these tools just to show that *IT IS* possible to
write a faster password cracker than Jackal's. another little problem with
cJack is that you cannot run it in the background with win16/32/nt (maybe
it run on os/2 by i dont install that shit only to play with cJack).
the console tools are harder to use for morons but i like them mainly
for the piping.

EXPECTED PERFORMANCE:

the programs have approx the same performance on 486s but who cares about
a 486
so watch out:to drag the best performance out this tool use iPentium or
AMD-K5


And now the fuckin' tools:

hsort:
******
like dos sort/jsort/etc reads from stdin sorts lines/writes to/stdout
also legal hsort <infile> <outfile> : if no <outfile> outfile=stdout
it doesn't have 640/64k limit
the temp files are stored in the dir shown by env TEMP so watch out
for enough disk space

xtr:
****
something like xtract
xtr -d -s file . . .
-d allow digits
-s allow any ASCII > ' ' and < '\x80'
wildcards supported

hpp:
****
this is a tool that i hated to write but anyway i released it:
hpp -opts <file>
reads lines from file, process them conforming to *opts* and spit'em to
stdout

*opts*
-rev      :revert words
-ref      :reflect words
-cut:x    :cut words to a size of x chars
-min:x    :discard words shorter than x chars
-max:x    :discard words longer than x chars
-s:string :append each char in string to words
-p:string :prefix words with each char in string
-d        :double the words
-inse:x:c :insert char c in position x (0 means before the word)
-upcl     :uppers last char of word
-lowe     :turns all output to lower
-upper    :turns all output to upper
-ct:xxxx  :case tool:for any x after ct: the letter in the same pos
           as the 'x' is uppered is x==u,lowered if x==l or unchanged
           if (x!='u' && x!='l')
-g:x      :gecos ripper:x=rip level:max level is 8:the bigger the level
           more combinations from the gecos words


this may look pretty limited but if you don't like it you may use TPU
that is more compatible with hardware and os-es than jpp (and also
more powerful)

huc:
***
huc -opts <passwd> [<wordlist>]
 *opts*
-s        :single mode
-uxx      :attack only users with uid xx
-p        :show cracked accounts
-r[file]  :restore cracking [from file]
-aName    :attack only accounts where !strcmp(login,'name')
<passwd>    password file
<wordlist>  word file (stdin if not given)
