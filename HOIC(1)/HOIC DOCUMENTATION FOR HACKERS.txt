OK!

So BASICALLY

HOIC is pretty useless
UNLESS it is used incombination with "BOOSTERS", AKA "SCRIPTS"/BOOST PACKS / BOOM BOOM POWER
These boosters come in the form of .HOIC scripts.


hoic scripts are very simple and follow VB6 mixed with vb.net syntax although slightly altered
here are the functions and globals that relate the HOIC:

booster -> This is a global variable that contains the contents of the current script (string)
Headers -> This is a global variable that is an array of strings, and will be used to form headers in requests sent to the target URL.  To add a header, simply do something like this:
Headers.Append("User-Agent: ") or Headers.Append("User-Agent:  x" + CStr(powerFactor)

lbIndex -> Index into list box (cant really be used outside of the program, useless to developers)
PostBuffer -> String buffer containig post paramets, ie PostBuffer = "lol=2&lolxd=5"
powerFactor -> Integer from 0-2, 0 being low, 1 being medium , 2 being high
totalbytessent -> a count of the number of bytes sent to the target already (presistent across each attack)
URL -> url to attack
UsePost -> boolean, true = uses post, otherwise itll use get
