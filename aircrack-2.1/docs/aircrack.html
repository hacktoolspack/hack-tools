<P><A NAME="q11" HREF="#q11">What is aircrack ?</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
aircrack is a 802.11 WEP key cracker. It implements the so-called Fluhrer
- Mantin - Shamir (FMS) attack, along with some new attacks by a talented
hacker named KoreK. When enough encrypted packets have been gathered,
aircrack can almost instantly recover the WEP key.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="q12" HREF="#q12">How does aircrack work ?</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Every WEP encrypted packet has an associated 3-byte initialization vector
(IV). Some IVs leak information about a certain byte of the key, thus
statistically the correct key emerges when a sufficient number of IVs have
been collected.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="q13" HREF="#q13">Is aircrack different from AirSnort ?</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It it much more efficient. AirSnort requires more than four million unique
IVs to crack a 104-bit WEP key, whereas aircrack only needs many times less
IVs. Additionnaly, post-2002 wifi equipments filter the "interesting" IVs
AirSnort relies on; on the other hand, aircrack can break a WEP key without
the need for said IVs.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="q14" HREF="#q14">How many packets are needed to recover a
WEP key ?</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It really depends on your luck and the way the IVs are distributed.
Most of the time, one million unique IVs (thus ~2M packets) are
enough. If you're very lucky only 500K IVs may be required; and if
you're out of luck you could need around 1.5M-2M unique IVs.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="q15" HREF="#q15">Your website (www.cr0.net) is down !</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
No it's not. However it is likely your http proxy blocks connections to
port 8040. If that's the case, use this <A HREF="http://linuxfromscratch.org/~devine/network/">aircrack mirror</A>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="q16" HREF="#q16">The sniffer I use seems unable to capture
any IVs !</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Obviously, you won't be able to capture encrypted data packets if there
is no wireless traffic... Make sure your wireless card is compatible with
the wlan: don't bother trying to crack an 11g-only network if all you have
is an 11b card ;-)
<P>
Also, if you're too far from the Access Point you'll only see the
(unencrypted) beacon frames which are at the lowest speed: 1 Mbps,
but you won't be able to capture traffic at higher speeds.
In this case, using a directionnal antenna with a strong gain may help.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="q17" HREF="#q17">I've got this huge pcap file but aircrack
doesn't find any IVs in it ?!</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
IVs captured from a WPA-protected wireless LAN are useless for WEP cracking,
and aircrack will automatically skip them. Also, you may want to specify the
MAC address of the Access Point you're attempting to crack; in case of 802.1X
(per-client WEP key) you should rather specify the MAC address of one
connected client.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="q18" HREF="#q18">I've got x million IVs but aircrack
doesn't find the key.</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>WEP cracking is not an exact science</B>. Sometimes luck is on your side,
and sometimes not. By gathering as many encrypted packets as possible,
you'll greatly increase your chances of finding the key. Also, raising the
fudge factor might help.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
First of all, you have to put the wireless interface in monitoring mode;
for example, if you have a Prism2 card and use linux-wlan-ng:
<P>
<PRE>
# wlanctl-ng wlan0 lnxreq_ifstate ifstate=enable
# wlanctl-ng wlan0 lnxreq_wlansniff enable=true channel=&lt;AP channel&gt;

# ifconfig wlan0 up
# airodump wlan0 wlan.pcap
</PRE>
<P>
Alternatively, if your driver is compatible with the wireless tools:
<P>
<PRE>
# iwconfig wlan0 mode Monitor
# iwconfig wlan0 channel &lt;AP channel&gt;
# iwpriv wlan0 monitor_type 1  (<I>hostap only</I>)
# ifconfig wlan0 up
# airodump wlan0 wlan.pcap
</PRE>
<P>
However, if you use an old (patched) version of the Orinoco driver you must
issue this command:
<P>
<PRE>
# iwpriv eth0 monitor 1 &lt;AP channel&gt;
</PRE>
<P>
I'd recommend you use airodump instead of tcpdump, because it can handle
large (&gt; 2 GB) capture files, and displays more meaningful information
about each AP (ESSID, total number of unique IVs ...).
<P>
Note that you can run both airodump and Kismet at the same time, but in this
case it is suggested to lock channel hopping ('L' in Kismet). For wardriving
purposes, I've included a shell script (hopper.sh) you can use to hop
between 11b/11g channels.

<P><A NAME="q23" HREF="#q23">There's not enough wireless traffic, what
can I do ?</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you control a host inside the wlan, you may start a ping flood
with <FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier">ping -f</FONT>.
<P>
Otherwise, you can launch a replay attack based on arp-request packets.
Although  we cannot say for sure that a packet is one of those (since the
data is encrypted), such packets have a fixed length and can be spotted
easily. By resending these packets again and again, the other host will
respond with encrypted replies thus providing new and possibly weak IVs.
<P>
First of all, you have to sniff long enough to get some potential arp-
request packets. Then you'll need two wireless cards: card #0 will resend
the packets over the air, and card #1 will monitor the encrypted replies.
<U>These cards' antennas must be at least 50cm away from each other!</U>
<P>
If you are far from the Access Point, I suggest you use two strong
directionnal antennas and wireless cards with a high output power;
otherwise you'll mostly see the very packets that you're resending.
<P>
We are going to use HostAP's wlan0ap interface in Master mode on the same
channel as the legitimate AP we're trying to crack (thanks to the guy who
wrote airpwn for this tip).

Yes. You'll need PEEK.DLL and PEEK5.SYS from AiroPeek. Also, you
may need MSVCR70.DLL - search Google for "index +of msvcr70". All
these files should be put in the same directory as airodump.exe

<P><A NAME="q36" HREF="#q36">What is the problem with Aironet and Prism2

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The 802.11 header appears to be correct, but the encrypted data itself
gets corrupted, probably because of the drivers. These cards can be used
for wardriving purposes, but are useless for WEP cracking under Windows.

<P><A NAME="q37" HREF="#q37">How do I force my Prism2 card to use the Agere

Open the hardware manager, select your card, "Update the driver", select
"Install from a specific location", select "Don't search, I will choose
the driver to install", click "Have disk", set the path to where the Agere
drivers have been unzipped, uncheck "Show compatible hardware", and finally
choose the "D-link Air DWL-660 Wireless PC Card" - answer yes to the
warning message. If airodump doesn't appear to work with the D-link, maybe
try with the "Samsung SEW-2001p Card".
<P>
When using the Agere driver, your Prism2 card can <B>only</B> be used in
monitor mode - for some reason, the driver fails to work in managed mode.

You can use the WZCOOK program included in the latest aircrack
distribution. This is experimental software, so it may or may not work
depending on your service pack level.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="q3A" HREF="#q3A">Does WZCOOK also recovers WPA keys ?</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
WZCOOK will display the PMK (Pairwise Master Key), a 256-bit value which is
the result of your passphrase hashed 4096 times together with the ESSID and
the ESSID length. You can't recover the passphrase itself except by performing
a bruteforce attack on the PMK. However, knowing the PMK is (in theory) enough
to connect to a WPA-protected wireless network.
