power of google dorking straight from the comfort of your command line.

GooDork offers powerfull use of googles search directives, by analyzing results
from searches using regular expressions that you supply.

So basically the purpose of GooDork is to combined Dorking with Regular expressions

GooDork allows you to apply regular expressions to any and all of the follow attributes of web applications

Another thing I must say is that I'm using python regexes, so please read up on that, though
staight forward text matching works just fine ;)
