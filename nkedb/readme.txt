Note: ( Updated Version) ;)

Updates include, Regestry Cloaking
is now enabled and WIN2k bug should
be fixed. Enjoy! ;)

-About- 
NakedBind 1.0 is a simple file binder,
the user may attach 1 through as many 
files as specified. Thus creating one
executable. Once the files are bound
each file will go through a process
Splitting/Encryption/Packing.
Allowing several files to be
bound together creating one
small little powerful 
executable file... 
Be good! ;)

When it comes to NakedBind there are
many options to choose from. Some of
these options are as listed here. At
least the important ones! ;)

-Registry Cloaking (Good Method if you 
want to trick someone who goes searching
through their registry after they execute
the bound files) Testing Stage, disabled
in version 1.0 PUBLIC =(

-Melting Options (This is an important
one, it's very helpful when deceiving
the victim. Erases any givin file
attached to the stub and bound into
one executable file.)

-Injection Options (Used to inject into
a *trusted* application, very helpful
when it comes to bypassing Firewalls!
Shoutz to Aphex for all that new tech.

-Delayed Execution Method (Very useful
if your just wanting to drop the file
on the machine and wait for a later
date to execute the file.)

-Advanced Execution Methods (Windows
folder, System folder, Temp folder,
current folder and Custom folder.

Visibility Execution Methods (Hide
window, Run Maximized, Run Minimized,
Read only and Autorun.


-Whats NEW in Version 1.0 Final-
-Stub is 1267 bytes =D
-Binder allows user to pack all files!!!
-User can add as many files as he or she wants.
-Smaller file size binder is 77k
-Drag and Drop
