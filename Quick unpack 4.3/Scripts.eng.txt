At first it's strongly recommended to read this manual with care and to the end. If you call functions without any sense the program may crash or you even may get BSOD and potentially lose some data. Only some of the functions can be called in arbitrary order also only some of the functions should be called because some of them are used for internal purposes and this manual clearly states such cases.
You can take a look at Lua scripting language manual (included in Scripts folder (Lua Manual.html) also www.lua.org) to learn more about scripts also you can examine examples of scripts from Scripts folder (*.txt files).
If something works the wrong way or not the way it's intended to work read this manual for about 5 more times and only then report a bug. :)
And now follow extra functions and variables that can be called and used in the scripts.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Functions
---------------------------------------------------------------

number AddBreak(number where,number type1,number type2)
where-address to put a break on
type1-can be equal to the following values:
	1-opcode breakpoint (1 byte). The only difference from the standard breakpoint is in the opcode which adds a bit stealth
	2-standard and well-known 0xCC break
	3-hardware break in DR0 register
	4-hardware break in DR1 register
	5-hardware break in DR2 register
	6-hardware break in DR3 register
type2-on what condition to put a break. Can be equal to the following values: 0-on execution, 1-on memory write, 3-on memory write and read. This value is used only then debug register is chosen (type1=3-6) it may equal any value otherwise
result-true if the breakpoint was enabled; false if error occurred (for example there are too many breakpoints (see DeleteBreak()))
The function adds a breakpoint to the breakpoint list. This newly added breakpoint is disabled by default (see EnableBreak()). Hardware breaks on memory write and on memory write and read have size of 1

number AddMemoryBreak(number start_addr,number size)
start_addr-start address of memory to break on
size-size of memory to break on
result-true if the breakpoint was set; false if error occurred (for example wrong range)
The function needs for the interrupt 14 to be hooked (see Hook()) and sets memory breakpoint on execution on passed range of pages. When the breakpoint is hit, it's removed. Don't expect it to work without PAE enabled

number AddModuleToUnhookList(string library)
library-library name which export shouldn't be hooked
result-always 0

number CutSections()
result-0 if success; -1 if error occurred (for example process is dead)
The function cuts last sections. When using this function it's usually necessary to rebuild TLS (see ProcessTLS()) and resources (see ProcessResources()). The function should be called only after the process was dumped (see Dump())

number DumpForRelocs()
result-0 if success; -1 if error occurred (for example process is dead)
To restore relocations (only for a DLL) one should either run extra DLL instance (see PreLoad()) or use this function. You should get to the OEP first and then call this function. The process then should be killed and started again only after that one can call RestoreImportRelocs() to rebuild relocations

number EmulateCPUID(number active)
active-can be equal to the following values: 0-disable emulation, 1-enable emulation

buf-string with data to find
length-size of buf in bytes
start-address to start the search from in VA
end-address to and the search in VA

The byte order in the memory is the same as byte order in the string. The function searches for the exact sequence of bytes so the given buffer should contain exact string of bytes
(example: "\104\101\108\108\111" denotes a string "hello"; it may also be supplied as string.char(0x68,0x65,0x6c,0x6c,0x6f))

number import_meth-import recovery method. Will the export table of the loaded modules be hooked depends on it (see SetMainBreaks()) and the import recovery method itself (see RestoreImportRelocs()). Can be equal to the following values: 0-Do not recover, 1-Smart method, 2-Smart method+tracer, 3-Load libraries only. If this variable equals 2 the export table of the loaded modules will be hooked. By default equals the chosen at the main program window radiobutton state

number import_rva-put import table at this RVA instead of adding extra section. By default equals Import RVA in the import program window

bool is_dll-is it dll being unpacked or not. you shouldn't change this value

number jmp_to_oep-OEP for the program to unpack, can be used for PreLoad(). This is RVA! By default equals OEP in the main program window

bool leave_direct_refs-leave call xxx/jmp xxx/mov reg,imm import functions as they are without converting to call []/jmp []/mov reg,[]. By default equals the chosen at the main program window checkbutton state

bool long_import-import hooking uses short but suspicious trampoline or long but more safe. Short trampoline also involves unmapping of module and allocating memory. By default equals the chosen at the main program window checkbutton state

number module_end-treat this number as the end for the module while processing import. The number is used to skip pointers that lead into the module. This is RVA! By default equals End of module for import in the main program window

string parameters-parameters to be passed to the application to unpack. By default equals Parameters in the main program window

bool path_libs-enable or disable restoration of full path for import libraries. By default equals the chosen at the main program window checkbutton state

number platform-equals 32 or 64. you shouldn't change this value

bool process_relocs-enable or disable relocations processing. By default equals the chosen at the main program window checkbutton state

bool protect_dr-enable or disable protection of the debug registers. The protection will work only if appropriate function was called (SetMainBreaks()). By default equals the chosen at the main program window checkbutton state

bool suspect_functions-enable or disable inclusion of suspect functions into import table. By default equals the chosen at the main program window checkbutton state

number thread_id-ID of the current thread in the process to unpack. Used mostly for internal purposes so it's strongly recommended to leave it unchanged

number time_delta-two RDTSC instructions or GetTickCount calls will give the following difference: random(0-255)+delta. If the most significant bit is set in delta QuickUnpack calculates the delta itself and adds low part to smooth time on interrupt. Keep in mind that this hook is system-wide. By default equals Time delta in the main program window

bool unhook_inaction-enable or disable dynamic export unhooking, this improves speed but needs no be disabled upon import processing. By default equals false

bool use_force-use force unpacking of not. By default equals the chosen at the main program window checkbutton state

bool use_tf-Trace() uses TF or disassembler to calculate next instruction address and set breakpoint. By default equals the chosen at the main program window checkbutton state

number version-equals 40300. you shouldn't change this value. it may be used only to decide can some script be run on current version or not. I'm not going to ensure complete compatibility with previous versions in order not to turn QuickUnpack into some monster like windows :) so it'll be good if some script is run only on version it's designed for but I'll try to maintain compatibility with previous versions

number victim_base-imagebase the file to unpack is loaded at. Used mostly for internal purposes so it's strongly recommended to leave it unchanged

number victim_handle-handle of the process to unpack. Used mostly for internal purposes so it's strongly recommended to leave it unchanged

number victim_id-PID of the process to unpack. Used mostly for internal purposes so it's strongly recommended to leave it unchanged

State of the process to unpack is described by the following variables (for x64 the names are the same, just extended size):
number EAX-eax/rax register
number EBX-ebx/rbx register
number ECX-ecx/rcx register
