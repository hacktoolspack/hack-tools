 You can see how many hops it takes to get to another Internet host by using the Trace utilities. <br>
 Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) advertise how many hops away from Internet backbone they are. Theoretically, the fewer hops it takes to get your data onto the backbone, the faster your access will be. <br><br>

<font color="#00E0FF"><b>IP address</b></font> - 
 the Internet Protocol address is a unique number that is used to represent every single computer or device on a TCP/IP network.
 The format of an IP address is a 32-bit numeric address written as four numbers separated by periods. Each number can be zero to 255 (for example, 192.223.56.12 could be an IP address). <br>
 Within an isolated network, you can assign IP addresses at random as long as each one is unique. However, connecting a private network to the Internet requires using registered IP addresses (called Internet addresses) to avoid duplicates. <br>
 The four numbers in an IP address are used in different ways to identify a particular network and a host on that network. The InterNIC Registration Service assigns Internet addresses from the following three classes. <br>
 Class A - supports 16 million hosts on each of 127 networks <br>
 Class B - supports 65,000 hosts on each of 16,000 networks <br>
 Class C - supports 254 hosts on each of 2 million networks <br>
 The number of unassigned Internet addresses is running out, so a new classless scheme called CIDR is gradually replacing the system based on classes A, B, and C and is tied to adoption of IPv6.<br><br>

  unique identification number called a TCP port. These ports are numbered 
  beginning with zero. Port numbers for client applications are dynamically
  assigned by the operating system when there is a request for service. Port
  numbers for server applications are preassigned by the IANA 
  (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) and do not change.
  &nbsp; A server application or process that uses TCP as a transport has at least
  one preassigned port number. For example, the preassigned port numbers for
  FTP server services are 20 (data) and 21 (control).<br><br>
