##
## This is the configuration file for the portable instance of Tor.
## You will only have to make changes here if you want to run a second
## instance of TorChat on the same machine. See the HowTo.
##
## If you want to run multiple instances, change SocksPort
## and the second (ONLY THE SECOND) port in HiddenServicePort below
## to something like (for example) this:
##
##   SocksPort 22209
##   HiddenServicePort 11009 127.0.0.1:22009
##
## Remember to change these same numbers in torchat.ini in the sections 
## [tor_portable] and [client] also. There also exists a more detailed HowTo.
## IMPORTANT: NEVER change the FIRST 11009 in HiddenServicePort, this is the
## port INSIDE the tunnel. This number is hardcoded, but since it is inside
## the tunnel it cannot collide, no matter how many instances you run. You
## must change only the second number, the forwarding target, as shown above.
